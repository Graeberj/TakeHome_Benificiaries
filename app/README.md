First Step was to create the empty activity and remove all the unnecessary code from the activity.
This included any of the Compose code that was generated by the template.

Next I wanted to create a structure that I wanted to follow for the app. This involved the following:
- creating a model data class for the data that I would be using in the app
- a custom view class/file for the list item that I would be using in the list
- a custom view class/file for the detail view that would be used to display the details of the item
- a custom view class/file for the full list view that would be used to display the full list of items
- a viewmodel class that would be used to store the data and handle the logic for the app
- a utility function to parse the json data from the file
